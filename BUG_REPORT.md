# Admin Panel Bug Report & Audit - Emission Main

## Overview
This report summarizes the audit and bug fixes performed on the Emission Admin Panel. Each section (Dashboard, Products, Orders, Enquiries, Masterpieces, Banners) has been reviewed for functional correctness and premium aesthetics.

## Critical Bug Fixes
| Issue | Severity | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-functional Details Button** | High | ✅ Fixed | The "View Details" button in the Orders list was a placeholder. It now opens a premium modal showing full customer details, itemized breakdown, and grand totals. |
| **Hardcoded Invoices** | Medium | ✅ Fixed | Invoice printing was using static company data. Implemented a full **Invoice Design Management** system (Backend + Frontend) with dynamic template support. |
| **Missing Masterpiece Management** | High | ✅ Fixed | The "Choose Your Masterpiece" section was hardcoded in the frontend. Created a new Collections management page and API to make this section 100% dynamic. |
| **Sidebar Navigation Gaps** | Low | ✅ Fixed | Added "Masterpieces" and "Invoice Design" links to the sidebar for better accessibility. |
| **Revenue Calculation Inconsistency** | Low | ✅ Fixed | Dashboard revenue stats were using mixed parsing methods. Standardized to `Number()` to ensure financial precision for large datasets. |

## Visual & UX Enhancements
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Added backdrop-blur and subtle borders to all modals and dropdowns.
- **Micro-animations**: Implemented CSS transitions for hover states on product cards and action buttons.
- **Premium Icons**: Integrated the full Lucide-react library with curated selection for better visual weight (e.g., `Palette` for design, `LayoutGrid` for masterpieces).

## Potential Future Risks & Recommendations
1. **Large Image Payloads**: If users upload many 5MB+ images, the frontend list might lag. Recommendation: Implement server-side image optimization (e.g., Sharp) to generate thumbnails.
2. **Search Optimization**: Current search is local (frontend-only). As the database grows to 1000+ items, we should switch to backend-side search using Prisma's `contains` filter.
3. **Audit Log**: Add a 'History' model to track which admin changed product prices or order statuses for better accountability.
